interesting, long term thinking, collegiality, cross-disciplinary,
frequent communication between members, lots of money and stable
funding.</p><p>Bell Labs was basically a playground for computer nerds. They had</p><ul><li><p>Management that understood the need for researcher independence
because they themselves had been technical researchers.</p></li><li><p>Stable funding because they were supported by a nationwide
monopoly.</p><blockquote><p>Stable funding was a crucial factor for research. It meant that AT&T
could take a long-term view and Bell Labs researchers had the freedom
to explore areas that might not have a near-term payoff and perhaps
never would. That’s a contrast with today’s world, in which planning
often seems to look ahead only a few months, and much effort is spent
on speculating about financial results for the next quarter.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Interesting people to work with</p><blockquote><p>More and more Bell Labs activities shifted to Murray Hill, and the
Labs left West Street entirely in 1966. By the 1960s, <strong>Murray Hill
housed over 3,000 people, at least 1,000 with PhDs in technical fields
like physics, chemistry, mathematics, and various flavors of
engineering.</strong>.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>Lots of hard and valuabe problems being fed to them by the business
of AT&T.</p></li></ul><p>To me this depicts a veritable breeding ground of ideas.</p><p>Why was Unix in particular successful? Many reasons, and [[Kernighan]]
lays them out in the first chapter. But the thing that stands out to
me, the thing that kept it going in those initial stages when it only
ran on the [[PDP-11]] and funding to continue the project had not even
been approved, was that [[Ken Thompson]] and the rest of the guys in
1127 <strong>wanted to use it</strong>. It was a toy. It was fun and helped them
get their work done better than anything else they had access to. Here
is what Ken Thompson says about Multics, the committee-designed,
massively funded operating system effort being worked on by three
large companies (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>Ken focused on the input/output subsystem, experience that proved
valuable when he began work on Unix, though in a 2019 interview, he
described his Multics work as being “a notch in a big wheel and it was
producing something that <strong>I didn’t want to use myself</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>This is starting to seem to me to be an absolutely crucial ingredient
to a successful scene: stuff to work on. That can come in many
specific forms, and the form depends on what type of scene it
is. Like, the stuff a music scene works on might be like variations on
a particular style, combinations of different instruments, etc. The
stuff a painting scene works on might be skill at photorealism,
depicting emotion with a limited color palette, etc.</p><p>And I would describe the generalization of that as &ldquo;people have stuff
to do.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t just bring people together and say &ldquo;Make a scene!&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s not enough to keep interesting people around. Interesting
people want to spend their time doing interesting things.</p><p>What am I trying to say? I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the best formulation
but maybe I&rsquo;m tyring to say <strong>a scene needs problems</strong>.</p><p>A scene without problems is just a social club.</p><p>A scene can certainly be a social club, and in fact I think that&rsquo;s
another crucial ingredient of a successful scene.</p><blockquote><p>The Unix room was just plain fun; there was always something going
on. Some people worked there almost exclusively and rarely used their
offices. Others would drop in multiple times a day for coffee and
conversation. It’s hard to overstate how important the Unix room was
for keeping up with what colleagues were doing, and for creating and
maintaining a sense of community.</p></blockquote><p>But a scene can&rsquo;t <em>just</em> be a social club.</p><p>An interesting scene attracts interesting people, even if they&rsquo;re only
tangentially related to the core subject matter of the scene. This
seems like a huge positive. Making interdisciplinary connections can
be powerful socially and politically, and visitors can certainly
contribute good ideas that haven&rsquo;t been thought of by the core scene
members.</p><blockquote><p>By this time, Ken was well known in the chess world, and sometimes
grandmasters would show up at the Labs to try their hand against
Belle, particularly for endgames. I met world champions Anatoly Karpov
and Vishy Anand just by being around on the right weekends.</p></blockquote></div><footer class=post__footer><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="tags__badge icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M32 19c0 1-1 2-1 2L21 31s-1 1-2 1-2-1-2-1L2 16c-1-1-1.4-2-1.4-2S0 12.5.0 11V3C0 1.5.8.8.8.8S1.5.0 3 0h8c1.5.0 3 .6 3 .6S15 1 16 2l15 15s1 1 1 2zM7 10a3 3 0 100-6 3 3 0 000 6z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=https://mroll.github.io/scenes.matthewroll.com/tags/funding/ rel=tag>Funding</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=https://mroll.github.io/scenes.matthewroll.com/tags/culture/ rel=tag>Culture</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=https://mroll.github.io/scenes.matthewroll.com/tags/tech/ rel=tag>Tech</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=https://mroll.github.io/scenes.matthewroll.com/tags/communication/ rel=tag>Communication</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Matt Roll</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Writes, codes, drinks coffee</div></div><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=https://mroll.github.io/scenes.matthewroll.com/blog/needs-problems/ rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Scene Needs Legible Problems</p></a></div></nav></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2021 Matt Roll.
