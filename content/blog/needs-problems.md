Writing up the notes for _UNIX_ one things occurs to me and that is
how important it is for a scene to have clear stuff to work
on. Someone joining the scene should be able to spend a little while
wandering around, talking to people, and tinkering in order to come up
with a research direction[^1]. Here is Brian Kernighan on his
experience joining Bell Labs as a full time employee (emphasis mine):

> When I got to Bell Labs as a permanent employee in 1969, no one told

> introduced to other people, encouraged to wander around, and left to

> this seems like it must have been daunting, but I don’t recall any

> summers I already knew people and some of the current projects.**[^2]

You can picture the opposite: newcomers don't have that much access to
more senior members, the current state of the art isn't well-known,
and it's hard to get a sense of who is working on what and with
whom. Even really bright people wouldn't stick around long, because
that's not a fun environment. There is nothing they feel they can sink
their teeth into.

So it's not just that a scene needs problems, a scene needs legible
problems. And legible to the whole community, not just the two or
three people who might be pioneering the scene. If those founders want
anything to grow around them, they need to cultivate community
resources such that it's easy for newcomers to get answers to a few
important questions:

1. What is everyone working on right now?
2. What are the open problems?
3. How do I start contributing?

Maybe there are more, and maybe there are better questinos, but I
think that's a decent start.

- **What Is Everyone Working On Right Now?**

  Pre-internet this was a hard thing to get an answer to right away. You
  probably had to attend an event or coincidentally see someone in a
  cafe in order to get this info. Both of those things are out of reach
  for anyone who isn't in the right location.
  
  With the internet, however, everyone in the scene can have a website,
  and the websites of anyone who would like to be included can be listed
  in a directory on a social media site that acts as a watering
  hole. Examples include subreddits, facebook groups, forums, etc.
  
  It's easy for a newcomer to browse everyone's personal profile and see
  what they're working on.

- **What Are The Open Problems?**

  This can also just be posted in a central location, like a community
  website. You can even have separate pages (or even whole blogs) for
  each problem where those interested can host discussion.

- **How Do I Start Contributing?**

  The specifics here depend on the scene, but in general GitHub Issues
  will work for almost anything. Tag a bunch of stuff with "good first
  issue". This can work even if the scene is not a software project, or
  even a "project" in the sense that the community is trying to build
  some singular thing. It can be useful to just let people know how to
  get started in the space.
  
  If it's a niche jazz scene, a "good first issue" can be "record ten
  [niche jazz] songs and post them to [forum]".


[^1]: I hesitated to use that phrase "research direction," but decided
to put it there because I think that's a useful generalization of what
a scene is doing. It's doing research. A scene is like a search engine
for better works of art, tools, knowledge, or whatever.
